# Forecasting Lake Michigan Water Levels

            

Part of the Time Series Analysis and Forecasting class at the University of Chicago's Master of Science in Analytics program 

## Project Intro/Objective
Build time series models to forecast monthly average water levels of Lake Michigan.

## Methods Used
- SARIMA
- SARIMAX 
- Dynamic Harmonic Regression 
- VAR

## Technologies 
- R Studio

## Dataset 
The data were pulled from the National Oceanic  &  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) API and weather.gov tables.

The dataset consists of 528 observations and spans the time period 1978-2021 on a monthly basis.
- Dependent variable: water level of Lake Michigan (in feet above sea level)
- Exogenous variables: average monthly air temperature in Chicago, average monthly precipitation in rainfall (in inches).

Forecast horizon: 5 years.
